# ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber)

## History: 
Developed in 2017 as part of the CRYSTALS project, Kyber was selected by NIST as the primary post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) during the PQC standardization process.

## Explanation: 
Kyber is a lattice-based algorithm that allows two parties to securely exchange a shared secret over an insecure channel. Lattice problems are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers.

## Purpose: 
To replace classical key exchange methods like RSA and Diffie-Hellman/ECDH, ensuring secure symmetric keys can be established even in a quantum era.
