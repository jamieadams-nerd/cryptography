This **Cryptography repository** contains practical examples of modern cryptography used in high-assurance and security-sensitive systems. This repository is intended for engineers working in regulated or high-assurance environments. It is not a collection of minimal demonstrations. The goal is to support correct implementation, standards compliance, and long-term maintainability.

Readers can expect clear explanations, readable examples, operating system and service configuration guidance, and references to relevant standards and security controls that explain what each cryptographic technique protects, how it is applied, and why it is appropriate in real-world systems.

The primary focus is on FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms. The repository explains how these algorithms are used in practice, without diving into their mathematical internals. The emphasis is on what each cryptographic mechanism is for and how it applies in real systems. For example, hashes are described in terms of data integrity, digital signatures in terms of authenticity and integrity, and encryption in terms of protecting confidentiality.

The repository includes source code, example configuration files, and supporting explanations. Configuration examples focus on real-world use cases, such as configuring existing operating system components or services to use specific cryptographic algorithms, cipher suites, key sizes, or protocol settings. For example, this may include configuring an operating system to run in FIPS mode, restricting a service to FIPS-approved cipher suites, or configuring a TLS service to use only algorithms provided by a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module. Where appropriate, the repository also provides links to relevant application programming interfaces and authoritative or security-controlled documentation so readers can trace each configuration back to approved interfaces and standards.

Each cryptographic mechanism is discussed in the context of the security objectives and controls it supports. Examples explain how encryption supports data confidentiality, how hashes and message authentication codes support integrity, how digital signatures support authenticity and integrity, and how key establishment supports secure communication channels. Where applicable, the documentation notes alignment with security control families defined in standards such as NIST SP 800-53, as well as cryptographic validation requirements defined in FIPS 140-2 for approved algorithms and validated implementations.

The repository also includes material related to post-quantum cryptography. These sections explain why post-quantum algorithms are needed and what categories of threats they address. The focus remains on practical usage and integration rather than mathematical detail.

Where possible, [post-quantum](PQC/README.md) examples include reference usage or configuration guidance. In some cases, traditional algorithms and post-quantum algorithms are discussed side by side to show how newer approaches can be integrated to satisfy the same security objectives as existing cryptographic mechanisms, even as validation programs such as FIPS evolve over time.
